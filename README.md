# One Page Site README File


## The Basics


My main premise for this site was for the information to be able to be accessed in one easy place.  I decided on displaying the information in the form of a carousel, in order to streamline the process of understanding the information. 

I wanted to have a ‘clean’ design for the website. Too much colour, or too many shapes on a page can detract from the informative and serious nature of the website.  I also think that using random animations with JavaScript, if not done with much purpose, can take away the simplicity of the website. I used a few modern tools to make the website smoother, like scroll-style: smooth or background-attachment: fixed to still add a modern feel to the site, but I did not intend to overdo the website with animations and I only used JavaScript for the key mechanics of the website. 

For what I did right, I believe I concisely displayed the information in a cleaner and readable format. The carousel was basic, but intuitive, and streamlined the reading process. I am also happy with the colour palette I used. Minimalist colour palettes are good for making items distinct and readable, while still having some visual flair. Using a few greys, reds, blacks, and whites allowed my items to be displayed well on an otherwise simple page. The timeline’s background also added a better-looking flow to the site without being invasive. 

There were a couple of intentions that I did not end up resolving at the end of the project. The most major of these was the timeline’s integration. I aimed for it to be a horizontal scrolling timeline such as the one found [here] (https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/defining-moments-timeline). Unfortunately, this would not work for a few reasons; first of all was the rigidity of the timeline that was created. I used the [W3Schools Tutorial] (https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_timeline.asp) for the timeline, which didn’t offer much room for the vertical line to be rotated, and the text boxes properly formatted at the same time. Second, I got feedback in the later stages of development of the timeline’s usability with mostly vertical websites. Overall this would make the timeline visually interesting, but not intuitive. 

The second part that I wanted to change was the size of the figure text for the images, and it’s positioning. Unfortunately, when I added a class to this text, it either removed the text altogether, or removed the text on the document. Regrettably, I had to leave it how it was before the change. 

Lastly was getting the footer to be immediately below the timeline. Due to how the timeline’s sizing worked, this was also not possible. I tried to change the size of the p command, but it only marginally changed its actual size, and I suspected it was an issue with the background image’s size. 

There are some other things I would have wished to change but they belong in the ‘Javascript Integration’ section below. 


## Javascript Integration

I used JavaScript for clicking between sections for the carousel. I learnt a valuable lesson on how ineffective my first iteration of it was. Changing the innerText of the website will muddle the SEO of the website for one, and will also hinder website performance. Keeping all of the text content in HTML does add more code to the script, but it streamlines the process of it changing better. My overall solution to this problem was roundabout in nature, but it did change the slides. However, I wanted to change the dots to change colour when clicked, but this was a finishing touch that I wasn’t able to change in time.

Learning about JavaScript, in a website setting was a challenge that I had underestimated at the beginning of the project. I used JavaScript for the carousel, but then not at all after that. My intention was to use it for the timeline section and make a second carousel. However, a second carousel would be too repetitive for the design, so I left the material as it was. 


## Closing Thoughts

In summary, I feel I could have done a lot more with this task. This site further demonstrated my ability to use HTML in interesting ways, but I spent much less of the time on JavaScript than I anticipated. The project does demonstrate an iota of understanding for JavaScript, but I did not extend myself in terms of coding ability. I spent much of the project writing out the information for the sections, instead of learning more about how it works. I also think I didn’t leave enough room to figure problems out for myself, instead relying on the help of others to correct my mistakes. If I had managed my time to be more focused on the JavaScript portion of this work, I would have been more satisfied with the website as a whole.
