                <h2>HOW BUSHFIRES START</h2> <p>A bushfire can start by many factors. Predominantly, the climate and the density of trees in the area can cause bushfires to not only start, but spread quickly. Most recently, the 2019 Black Summer in Australia managed to burn 5.4 million hectares of the New South Wales landscape. Major reasons for this starting was that 2019 was the dryest recorded year at the time. Furthermore, the dense vegetation in the NSW area, combined with strong winds, caused the fires to spread to residential settlements-- leaving many locals without a home. But overall, the ingition source is usually a lightning strike (Geoscience Australia, 2023); the dryer weather and strong winds just keep it burning for longer.</p> <p> Bushfires are more commonly started by a culmination of natural factors, though human involvement have played roles in some of the most catastrophic fires in the world. <cite> Though intentional fires with malicious intent are only around one percent in NSW </cite> (Nguyen et. al 2020) <cite> and about four percent in Victoria </cite> (Readfern, 2020), accidental causes of fires such as cigarettes, use of electrical equipment in vegetation-dense areas, and unextinguished campfires can also be a danger. <cite> Across NSW and Victoria from 1997-2009 47 percent of them were accidental (Salleh, 2015) </cite> </p> <p> There is also the factor that climate change has on the frequency of bushfires. Climate change has been resposible for changes in global radiation balance and increasingly dryer weather. In Australia, the Forest Fire Danger Index (FFDI) indicates how likely it is for the region to have a bushfire.</p>

                <br>Forest Fire Danger Index that goes from 0 (low-moderate) to 100 (catastrophic).

                <p> This index has only been rising year by year due to increasing humidity in Australian territories. <cite> In 2019, the fire index annual mean was 1.52&degC above the average </cite> (Doyle, 2020) . In recent times, the Fire Rating has rarely dipped below 50 for all states aside from alpine regions. As all of these factors are complicated or unchangable factors, halting climate change is the first step to making sure that bushfire frequency stays stagnant or recedes.   </p>

                <h2>THE IMPACT</h2> <p>A large bushfire has the capacity to destroy many different environments, ecosystems, and communities depending on the location. The most obvious impact is the affect bushfires have on the environment it started in. Vegetation takes time to grow back in bushfire-scorched areas, only exacerbated by increased dryness. If the plants or trees aren't completely incinerated, parts of them can be left partially damaged, allowing for insect infestation, and an overall drop in value for trade. A partially burnt tree is prone to falling over because of the lack of stability. Recent fires will also send thick layers of smog into the atmosphere, which can limit the area's subjection to sunlight. The vegetation, is prevented from growing back because of the lack of sunlight and amount of water in the location.</p><p>Bushfires have quite a large impact on the biodiversity of an ecosystem. The way it impacts them comes in many forms; insects and smaller animals can simply be incinerated by the instance of the fires. For larger animals, it can be more painful. The smog that forms can affect animal respiratory systems, causing them to die from those complications. The fires will destroy burrows for creatures, leaving them open to predators. The food chain of the ecosystem is harmed substantially because of the lack of insect life and the sparsity of the middle-range prey. Forests, for example hold eighty percent of all terrestrial species and insects (United Nations, n.d), but they are also the most commonly affected by the devastating fires. The bushfires of 2019-2020 alone caused a 14 percent increase in threatened species (Reiner, 2020). Along with Australia's appaling environmental practices, the amount of endangered species has siginificantly increased. In terms of habitat loss, 85 percent of terrestrial threatened species have suffered habitat loss since 2000(Ward et. al, 2019). A large portion of this is due to bushfires. Of all the impacts of fires, the damage that it causes to ecosystems is the most permanent. </p> <img src="https://www.bushfirefront.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Footless-quokka-LR.jpg" alt="Quokka that perished in a bushfire" />
                <br> Quokka that perished in a bushfire. (Src: <a href="https://www.bushfirefront.org.au/home/fire-facts/impacts-of-bushfires/">https://www.bushfirefront.org.au/home/fire-facts/impacts-of-bushfires/ )</a> <p> Bushfires have shown to affect communities in myriad of aspects. Infrastructure can be affected through the spreading of fires that are in close proximity to settlements. For example, the 2008-2009 Black Saturday incident that started in south eastern Australia, which spread through the Great Dividing Range and dealt significant damages to the metropolitan Melbourne area. During this time, the state was going through a large heat wave, the temperatures getting as high as 43&deg;C (Australian Disaster Resilience, n.d), as well as strong winds. The fires were mainly started by arson, and collapsed power lines. Overall, the fires caused 173 fatalities, 2029 homes were destroyed, and it resulted in $1.07 billion in insurance costs, in Victoria alone (Australian Disaster Resilience, n.d). </p> <a  target="_blank" href="src/assets/StatewideFiresOverview_20090406.pdf">Victoria Statewide Fires Overview 2009</a> <p>
                    According to the Forest Fires Management of Victoria, it left eighty cities as "unrecognisable." The Black Saturday bushfires are largely considered as the most catastrophic bushfire outbreak in Australian History. But it isn't just the effect of the blaze that can cause the casualties. The 2019-2020 Black Summer sent large amount of smog into the air, making the air quality extremely harmful to human respiratory systems. The air quality, on severe days would get up to 70 μg m−3 on several days. (Graham et. al, 2021)

                <h2> WHAT SHOULD WE DO? </h2> <p> From an individual standpoint, the things one can do may seem insignificant, but can prevent serious fires from starting or breaking out further. Firstly, be cognisant of flamable items, such as cigarettes, or electrical appliances. Be careful with campfires in dense vegetation. Follow total fire ban rules. Total fire bans are quite frequent, so check your local state's fire bans before starting any naked fires. If you see any large fires breaking out, get to a safe place, and dial your emergency phone number (000 for Australia).  </p>
                <a href="src/assets/Emergency Survival Plan.pdf">ACT Emergency Survival Guide (works for all states) </a> <p> A group effort to change the frequency of bushfires is a far more complicated dilemma. Holding back Climate Change would change the frequency of bushfires, as well as commonality of dry weather. But as doing so is an issue that can't be fixed in a short period of time. In Australia, we have many legislations still in place that damage the biodiversity of Australian forests. Land clearing and deforestation is turning the once lush parts of the country into areas for urbanisation, affecting the habitats. Voting out some of these practices may help endangered species survive. Bushfire-touched communities should have access to significant funding for recovery. Australia is getting better with financial recovery for hurt settlements since it is now very common, but the funding needs to be reserved for particularly catastrophic events. It is important to inform others about what to do in a bushfire through social media and word of mouth. </p>
